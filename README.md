# IT Operations Reliability Analytics Dashboard
Python + Power BI Project | Incident & System Reliability Analysis

### Project Overview
## 📊 Dashboard Preview

![IT Ops Dashboard](visuals/IToperationsdashboard.png)

Modern IT teams rely on fast incident resolution and stable systems to maintain business continuity.
This project analyzes simulated IT operations incident data to identify reliability risks, resolution bottlenecks, and system-level performance trends.

Using Python and Power BI, this dashboard transforms raw incident logs into actionable insights that help leadership monitor operational health and prioritize system improvements.

This project simulates a real-world internal analytics use case for IT Operations, Site Reliability, and Business Intelligence teams.

### Business Problem

Organizations often struggle to answer:

Which systems generate the most incidents?

Where are resolution delays happening?

Which incident types create the highest operational risk?

How can reliability be measured consistently?

Without clear dashboards, IT teams operate reactively instead of proactively.

This project builds a structured analytics workflow to monitor reliability and improve operational decision-making.

### Tools & Technologies

Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) — data cleaning & analysis

Jupyter Notebook — exploratory analysis & metrics

Power BI — executive dashboard & visual storytelling

Excel/CSV — dataset simulation & storage

GitHub — version control & portfolio showcase

### Key Metrics Calculated

Incident volume by system

Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR)

Incident severity distribution

Resolution time trends

System risk score

Reliability comparison across systems

### Key Insights

Certain systems generated significantly higher incident counts, indicating reliability concerns.

High-severity incidents showed longer resolution times, increasing operational risk.

A small number of systems contributed disproportionately to downtime.

MTTR trends revealed opportunities to improve escalation and response workflows.

Risk scoring highlighted which systems should be prioritized for reliability improvements.

### Dashboard Features
